# hushsend — project guide for Claude Code

Privacy-first P2P file transfer. Browser-to-browser over WebRTC/DTLS (end-to-end); the
server only does **signaling** (rendezvous + relaying opaque SDP/ICE). The signaling server
is **untrusted** — all confidentiality and authenticity are established client-side
(PAKE / SAS + DTLS), with TOFU key pinning.

Repo layout: the Vite frontend is at the repo root; the signaling server lives in `server/`
(own `package.json`, dep `ws`) so it can be split into its own repo later. Keep it
self-contained; do **not** create a shared types package between client and server —
duplicate the small signaling protocol instead.

## Keep this file in sync (read this first)
This file + the repo are the ONLY context a fresh session has — sessions do not remember prior
work. So whenever a change alters the app's actual state, update this file in the SAME pass:
- completing or advancing a build step → update **Build order** and **Current state** markers;
- adding / removing / renaming a core module → update the file lists in **Current state**;
- changing a protocol, constant, or invariant → update the relevant **Crypto** / method section;
- deferring something → note it under **Known residuals / deferred**.
- forward-looking / deferred work (step 6, follow-ups, nice-to-haves) lives in **BACKLOG.md** —
  read it when picking the next task, and update it in the SAME pass as this file when items land.
Stale markers (e.g. a finished step still marked 🚧, or a built module missing from the
inventory) cause real rework for the next session. Treat doc drift as a bug.

## Stack (locked — do not swap)
- React + TypeScript, **Vite** — static SPA, **no SSR** (SSR contradicts the threat model).
- **Redux Toolkit** slices. **No RTK Query** (no REST surface; signaling is WebSocket,
  everything else is P2P DataChannel).
- No router — screens are driven by connection state.
- Raw `RTCPeerConnection` + `RTCDataChannel` (NOT PeerJS/simple-peer — we need control of
  SDP and the DTLS fingerprint for channel binding).
- Crypto: `@noble/curves` (+ `@noble/hashes`); WebCrypto where available.
- `zod` for validating inbound signaling frames.
- ESLint + Prettier; **Vitest** (unit) and **Playwright** (e2e, Chromium) — keep both suites green.

## Architecture — the one rule
All non-serializable, live objects (`RTCPeerConnection`, `RTCDataChannel`, `WebSocket`,
`CryptoKey`) live ONLY in the imperative core (`src/core/`, in `SessionController` and its
sub-modules). They never enter the Redux store and React never holds them. One-way flow:

`UI → SessionController method → work + dispatch → store → useSelector → UI`

The store holds only serializable projections (status, peer label, words to display,
transfer progress, error). RTK's serializability check stays ON.

## Connection state machine
`src/store/connectionSlice.ts` is the FSM: a single `status` field + an `ALLOWED` transition
map + a `canGo` guard. States: `idle | creating | awaitingPeer | joining | pairing |
awaitingSas | confirming | connected | failed`. Illegal transitions are ignored (warn in dev).
(Identity enrollment is an action on `connected`, not a state; SAS timeouts lead to `failed`
without adding states. **Reconnect re-auth (4b-ii) adds NO states** — it reuses `pairing →
confirming → connected | failed`, and `pairing → awaitingSas` when it falls back to SAS.)

**Hard invariant:** no file bytes flow unless the connection is authenticated (status reaches
`connected` / the `established` gate, i.e. after key-confirmation or mutual SAS-confirm). Keep
this as a single gate check.

## Connection methods (4)
All four resolve to the same FSM and the same DataChannel transfer; they differ only in how
peers rendezvous + authenticate.

### Per-pairing role (initiator/responder) — by readable-id order
`this.role` (the transport/crypto initiator|responder) is fixed **PER-PAIRING from the two readable
ids** — the lexicographically **smaller id is the `initiator`**, the larger the `responder`
(`src/core/pairingRole.ts` `pairingRoleFor`, unit-tested in `pairingRole.test.ts`) — **NOT** from
create/join. This is the SAME id ordering as the SAS reader/picker split (`sasRoleFor`: smaller id =
reader), so on any pair the initiator is also the reader. **Why:** the room is a mesh lobby, so a 1:1
pair can be creator↔joiner OR joiner↔joiner; under the old "creator = initiator" rule two joiners were
**both `responder`** → nobody sent the WebRTC offer and the SAS commit-reveal (responder commits
first) deadlocked. Fixing the role from the ids guarantees exactly one initiator + one responder for
ANY pair; both peers compute it identically (ids are unique in a room) → opposite roles. It is
assigned once at pairing start (`SessionController.beginPairing`, both ids known) and drives: the
**WebRTC offer/answer** direction (initiator offers — sent by the smaller id, by EITHER side, not
"always the creator"), **CPace** init/respond (words), the **SAS** nonce order + commit-reveal (room,
mirrored into `sas.role`), and the **`lv(role)`** label in the **key-confirmation** (words/link/qr)
and **enrollment** transcripts. **For a 1:1 creator↔joiner pair the OUTCOME is unchanged** — same
connection, same authentication; only WHICH side offers/reveals first is now id-ordered. **Fail
closed**: an unresolved role (missing/equal id) hard-fails the pairing rather than defaulting a side
(a default could land both on the same role and deadlock). **Exception — reconnect:** the reconnect
PROTOCOL role (who announces the pairingId / who proves first / `lv(role)` in the reconnect
transcript) **stays create/join** (creator = reconnect initiator), independent of `this.role`, so the
verifier-first side is fixed and a key change is caught before a forger can settle; reconnect is 1:1
creator↔joiner (mesh reconnect is a later step). This per-pairing-role pass is the foundation for the
**Room lobby** (below), which is now built (step 6): the room method no longer auto-pairs — the human
picks whom to pair with, and the per-pairing role lets ANY pair (incl. joiner↔joiner) raise a correct
1:1 channel. words/link/qr still auto-pair 1:1 with the single peer.

### Room lobby (mesh — roster + pick) — done (step 6)
The 4-digit room is a **mesh LOBBY**, and the client now exposes it: the room method NO LONGER
auto-pairs. **Both the creator AND every joiner land in `awaitingPeer`** (a joiner takes the new
`joining → awaitingPeer` transition — no new FSM state) and see the same `LobbyScreen`: the shareable
4-digit code + a **roster** of everyone else in the room, each with a **Connect** button. The human
PICKS whom to raise a 1:1 channel with.
- **Roster projection**: `connection.roster: PeerInfo[]` (`{id, device, joinedAt}`), maintained by the
  core from signaling — `welcome` (set the existing peers) / `peer-joined` (add) / `peer-left` (remove,
  also clearing a stale busy notice). Serializable; the live objects stay in the core. (Seeded for all
  methods, but only the room `LobbyScreen` renders it.)
- **Pick → connect handshake** (room only, over the signaling relay; carries no secret — the SAS
  authenticates). On a pick the client sends the target a **`pair-request`** and engages via
  `beginPairing`, where the **per-pairing role decides who offers**: the **smaller id (initiator) sends
  the WebRTC offer** — on its own pick OR on a `pair-request` from the responder — while the larger id
  (responder) readies its answerer, sends its SAS commit, and waits. The `pair-request` readies the
  counterpart before the offer arrives. **Glare** (both pick each other) resolves naturally — only the
  smaller id offers; **dedup** is by `this.peerId`/`this.peer` (a duplicate pick, or a pair-request from
  the peer we already engaged, is ignored). Then the normal pairing → SAS (reader/picker by id) →
  `connected` → transfer runs, for ANY pair including **joiner↔joiner**.
- **Busy-reject**: a `pair-request` from a peer while we are already pairing/connected with a DIFFERENT
  peer → we send that peer **`busy`**. The picker receiving `busy` tears down its half-started attempt
  and **returns to the lobby** (`pairing → awaitingPeer`, room + roster intact) with a clear "X is busy"
  notice (`connection.notice`) — a clean rejection, never a hang; it can pick someone else. The busy
  peer's own session is undisturbed (it drops the stray offer/commit via the `from !== peerId` gate).
- **Lobby control frames** (`pair-request` / `busy`) are handled in `onSignal` BEFORE the 1:1
  `from !== peerId` gate (a pick can come from a peer we are not yet paired with). `LobbyScreen` is
  gated on the plain SAS room (`dev.reconnect.active` false); **reconnect** keeps the simple code screen
  (`RoomCreateScreen`) and **auto-pairs** 1:1 (reconnect-in-lobby is deferred). **words/link/qr are NOT
  lobbies** — they auto-pair 1:1 with the single peer (only `peers[0].id` is read from the new welcome
  form). `LobbyScreen` (`src/ui/screens/`) + `pickPeer`/`onPairRequest`/`onBusy` in `SessionController`;
  e2e in `tests/e2e/lobby.spec.ts` (joiner↔joiner + busy).

- **link** — high-entropy one-time secret S in the URL **fragment** (`#…`), scrubbed via
  `history.replaceState` immediately after read (never sent to the server). No PAKE, no SAS —
  S authenticates the channel itself via key-confirmation. *(done — 5b; see below)*
- **qr** — same as link; the same link is shown/scanned as a QR. *(done — 5b; see below)*
- **room** — server allocates a 4-digit code (public, not secret) that names a **mesh LOBBY**
  (up to `maxPeers`, default 8). Several peers can sit in the same room; the client shows a **roster +
  Connect button per peer** and the human PICKS whom to raise a 1:1 DataChannel with — any pair,
  INCLUDING joiner↔joiner — and that pair runs its own SAS + transfer (see **Room lobby** below). After
  a pair connects the two humans compare a **SAS** (3 words from EFF short #2) out-of-band. SAS is
  mandatory and unskippable; the key-changed / mismatch path is a hard stop, not a dismissable toast.
  **link/qr do NOT share this 4-digit lobby** — they rendezvous via their own high-entropy **token**
  (`codeType=token`, strictly 1:1), so a stray peer can't reach the room. *(SAS done — 4a;
  lobby UI done — 6c; lobby seat cap codeType-dependent — see below.)*
- **words** — PAKE-authenticated, **no SAS**. See below.

### words method (finalized)
A reads a phrase aloud (voice OOB), B reproduces it by **selecting**, not free-typing. PAKE
makes the low-entropy spoken phrase safe (attacker limited to online guessing; the
untrusted-server transcript is not offline-attackable).

- Wordlist: **EFF short list #2 (1296 words)** — each word has a unique 3-character prefix
  (fast autocomplete) and the list is misread-resistant (good for a voice channel). Generate
  with a **CSPRNG**, uniform, rejection-sampled (no modulo bias). Never user-chosen.
- Phrase = **5 words = 1 rendezvous + 4 secret** (~41-bit secret).
  - **rendezvous word** = room id. PUBLIC, server-allocated, from the same EFF short #2 list.
  - **4 secret words** = the CPace password. Client-generated, **never sent to the server**.
- A-side: `create=1&codeType=word` → server allocates rendezvous word from EFF short #2 →
  client generates 4 secret words → shows all 5 in order → A reads them aloud → waits
  (`awaitingPeer`).
- B-side picker: 5 positions, each its own **autocomplete** input over the **full** wordlist
  (type ≥3 chars → unique word → tap). The per-position list MUST be the full list — never a
  short "correct + decoys" set (B can't know the answer; transmitting candidates would leak
  the set to the server and collapse entropy).
- On all 5 selected: split → word 1 = rendezvous → `room=<word1>` join; words 2–5 = CPace
  password (PRS), canonical join format: `utf8ToBytes(secret.map(w => w.toLowerCase()).join('\n'))`.
- Pairing: **CPace** (draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21, CPACE-RISTRETTO255-SHA512) over signaling
  new `{kind:'cpace', sid?, msg}` frames (sid = 16-byte session nonce, initiator generates
  and sends on first frame; responder echoes). → shared key K. The CPace initiator/responder is the
  **per-pairing role** (smaller readable id = initiator, see **Per-pairing role**) — for words the
  rendezvous is strictly 1:1 so it is always creator+joiner, but which of the two is the initiator
  is id-ordered, not create/join. Exchange offer/answer/ICE → DTLS. **Key-confirmation:** each side MACs the negotiated DTLS fingerprint (the one from
  received SDP, that DTLS validates) + role label under K via HKDF-SHA512 derivation, exchanges
  it over a DataChannel control message `{kind:'confirm', role?, tag}`; verify with
  `equalBytes` → `connected`; mismatch (wrong words or MITM) → `failed`, no data. **No SAS** —
  successful CPace + key-confirmation IS the authentication.
- **Rate-limit / TTL**: word-room windows are bounded by **MAX_PAIRING_ATTEMPTS = 10**
  (failed CPace/confirmation/peer-drop/transport-abort counts as an attempt). On reaching the
  cap or if a server-side TTL (**WORD_ROOM_TTL_MS = 180000**, ~3 min) expires **before**
  `connected`, the word-room is invalidated → invalidates the rendezvous. After `connected`,
  TTL does NOT tear down the already-authenticated P2P connection; signaling closes but the
  DataChannel persists, allowing long transfers (10GB+ at typical speeds may exceed 3 min).
  A counts attempts and can manually regenerate (fresh 5 words, new room). This bounds online
  guessing: ≤10 tries × ~2 per guess ≈ 2^4 vs 2^41 secret space.
- Server: word-rooms cap at **2 peers max** (creator + one joiner; 3rd joiner bounced with
  `4002 'room full'`). This serializes guesses and ensures the room is 1:1.

### room method (SAS) — done
Server allocates a 4-digit public code that names a **mesh LOBBY** (see **Room lobby** above): peers
join, see each other on a roster, and the human PICKS whom to raise a 1:1 channel with (any pair,
incl. joiner↔joiner). Once a pair connects, the two humans compare a short string (SAS) **out-of-band**
(voice/QR/etc.) — the MITM check.

**SAS design (commit-before-reveal, per ZRTP / Vaudenay)**: to prevent a MITM-server from
grinding certs to match SAS on both sides, reveal the SAS only after committing to random
nonces:
  (Roles below are the PER-PAIRING transport/crypto roles — initiator = the lexicographically
  SMALLER readable id, responder = the larger — NOT create/join. See **Per-pairing role** above; the
  SAS responder commits first regardless of who created the room, so a joiner↔joiner pair never has
  both sides committing.)
- Responder sends `{kind:'sas-commit', c}` where `c = SHA-256("hushsend/sas/commit"
  || nonceR)`, nonceR = 16 random bytes. Initiator sends `{kind:'sas-nonce', nonce: nonceI}`.
- Responder reveals `{kind:'sas-nonce', nonce: nonceR}`. The initiator verifies `c = SHA-256(...)`
  with `equalBytes` (abort on mismatch). Order is critical: the responder is committed before the
  initiator's nonce is revealed. Both derive (HKDF-SHA512, same KDF as the words key-confirmation;
  `nonceA`/`nonceB` below = initiator's/responder's nonce, bound in fixed role order):
```
  SAS = HKDF-SHA512(IKM = lv(nonceA) || lv(nonceB) || lv(fp_min) || lv(fp_max),
                    salt = ∅, info = "hushsend/sas")
```
  where `fp_min/fp_max` = sorted DTLS fingerprints (lexicographic order, same canonicalization
  as words key-confirmation), `lv` = length-prefix. The commitment `c` stays SHA-256 (a hash is
  the right primitive for a binding commitment). Then render SAS as **3 words from EFF short #2**
  (≈31 bits, readable aloud); each word index is a bias-free 8-byte reduction of the HKDF output.
  Both sides must derive the same triple.
- **Exchange over DataChannel**: each side sends `{kind:'sas-confirm', ok: <bool>}` after the
  human either confirms (both SAS match) or denies (mismatch). Both must confirm → `connected`;
  any deny/timeout/abort → `failed`. This is not a cryptographic boundary (SAS already
  authenticated the channel via fingerprint binding), but a **coordination gate** ensuring both
  sides agree on authenticity before allowing data transfer.
- **UI confirmation — ASYMMETRIC "pick from 3 phrases" (crypto unchanged)**: `sas.ts` and
  the `sas-confirm{ok}` protocol are untouched. The screen is split by role so the pick actually
  defends against a MITM:
  - the **READER** is shown its phrase (`sas-words`), reads the 3 words aloud, then confirms (or aborts);
  - the **BLIND PICKER** is NEVER shown the phrase on its own, only 3 indistinguishable options (the
    REAL phrase + **2 LOCAL display-only decoys**: same EFF short #2 list, same 3-word format, distinct
    from the real one and each other, randomised order, never sent), and must identify the phrase by
    LISTENING to the reader.

  This split is the whole point: a picker that could see its own phrase would click it without
  listening, giving no protection. Blind, the picker catches a MITM (which makes the two sides derive
  DIFFERENT phrases) — the read phrase is not among the picker's options → "none of these match" →
  `confirmSas(false)` → both abort. `confirmSas(true)` fires only when the picker selects the real
  phrase (the reader confirms its peer found it). Entropy is preserved (full phrase vs full phrase);
  the decoys are pure UI. The decoy build + pick scoring is isolated in `sasOptions.ts` and
  unit-tested (`sasOptions.test.ts`).
  - **SAS role is PER-PAIRING, by readable-id order (NOT create/join)**: since the room is a mesh
    lobby, a pair can be creator↔joiner OR joiner↔joiner — "creator reads" would make two joiners both
    pickers (no reader). Instead each 1:1 pair fixes the role from the two readable ids: the
    lexicographically **smaller id is the reader**, the other the picker (`src/core/sasRole.ts`
    `sasRoleFor`, unit-tested in `sasRole.test.ts`). Both peers compute it identically (ids are unique
    in a room) → opposite roles, for ANY pair. The core computes it at pairing start (both ids known)
    and projects it as `connection.sasRole`; `SasScreen` reads it. The readable id is a LABEL (not
    identity) used ONLY to split the asymmetric UI roles — the SAS crypto is what authenticates. **Fail
    closed**: if the role is unresolved (`null` — a missing id), `SasScreen` renders the "restart
    verification" screen, NEVER a functional blind picker (this closes the BACKLOG fail-closed item).
    The reader/picker split is a UI-only signal, but it shares the SAME id ordering as the
    transport/crypto role (`sas.role`, see **Per-pairing role** above): the smaller id is both the
    initiator (reveals after the commit) AND the reader. So reader↔initiator and picker↔responder line
    up on every pair, by construction.
- **Timeouts**: one reused timer bounds the coordination phases, default **120000 ms** (~2 min).
  It arms at pairing-start (`beginPairing`) to bound the pre-SAS pairing window (peer sent commit but
  withheld its nonce → no longer hangs), then re-arms at SAS-display to bound the comparison + confirm
  window. **Both phases are PROD-fixed at the 120 s default** but each reads its duration through a
  SEPARATE DEV-only override so e2e can drive each timeout branch in ~hundreds of ms / a few seconds
  instead of a real 120 s wait, both gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` (dead-code / tree-shaken in
  prod): the pre-SAS window via **`preSasTimeoutMs()`** (`?preSasTimeoutMs=N` /
  `window.__HUSHSEND_PRE_SAS_TIMEOUT_MS__`) and the comparison window via **`sasConfirmTimeoutMs()`**
  (`?sasTimeoutMs=N` / `window.__HUSHSEND_SAS_TIMEOUT_MS__`). They are kept SEPARATE deliberately —
  shrinking one must not pre-empt the other's state under test (the comparison-timeout e2e relies on
  the pre-SAS window keeping its default while only the comparison one shrinks). On expiry → `failSas`
  → `failed` + close, same path as deny/abort. The pre-SAS deadline is **RE-ARMED when the relax relay
  offer surfaces** (legitimate longer escalation window — see § Privacy mode + ICE / relax-retry). The
  pre-SAS deadline's **FIRING direction is e2e-tested** (`?stallSasNonce=1` makes a peer reach the SAS
  but withhold its nonce reveal → the other side fails at the shrunk pre-SAS deadline, not hangs —
  `tests/e2e/room-sas.spec.ts`).
- **Inbound validation**: `sas-commit` / `sas-nonce` frames are zod-validated to exact decoded
  lengths (commit = 32 bytes, nonce = 16 bytes); malformed / short / odd-hex frames are rejected
  before any crypto (untrusted relay).
- **Server cap / TTL / rate-limit (done — 6a, lobby cap added later)**: the 4-digit room is a
  **`managed`** room, which governs the TTL + per-IP rate-limit. The **seat cap is codeType-dependent,
  NOT the `managed` flag**: the 4-digit **room** rendezvous is a **LOBBY** up to **`maxPeers`**
  (`FILETRANSFER_MAX_PEERS`, default **8**); the **words** AND the link/qr **token** rendezvous are
  strictly 1:1 (`ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS = 2`) — words to serialize secret-word guessing, token because a
  one-time link/qr has a single receiver. A joiner past the cap is bounced with **4002 `'room full'`**.
  The room self-destructs after a short TTL **before `connected`**, freeing the code (a later join →
  **4009 `'room not found'`**; after `connected`, closing signaling does NOT drop the live P2P
  channel). The **4-digit lobby TTL is an IDLE timeout** (`ROOM_TTL_MS = 180000`, ~3 min): every JOIN
  re-arms it, so an actively-joined lobby lives while a stale one expires. The **words AND token TTLs
  stay armed from CREATE** (`WORD_ROOM_TTL_MS` / `TOKEN_ROOM_TTL_MS`, both 180000) and do NOT re-arm (a
  re-arm would let an attacker keep a 1:1 room alive by rejoining). **Per-IP create/join attempts are
  rate-limited** (`IP_RL_MAX =
  60` / `IP_RL_WINDOW_MS = 60000`; over → **4011 `'too many attempts'`**) to slow enumeration of the
  small 10k space; loopback is EXEMPT (behind nginx a real client always arrives via `X-Real-IP`, never
  loopback). SAS still defeats a MITM regardless — this is abuse hygiene. See **Signaling server**
  below; tested in `tests/integration/room-server.test.ts`.

### link / qr method (finalized — 5b)
A high-entropy ONE-TIME secret in the URL fragment authenticates the channel directly — **no PAKE,
no SAS, no human comparison, no reader/picker**. (The full-entropy secret is not offline-guessable,
so a PAKE is unnecessary; the secret authenticates by itself, so a SAS is unnecessary.) link and qr
are the SAME path — qr only renders/scans the same link. Lives in `src/core/link/link.ts` (pure:
generate / build / parse) + the link/qr branches in `SessionController`; no new FSM states.

- **Secret S**: `LINK_SECRET_BYTES = 16` CSPRNG bytes (128 bits), base64url-encoded, never
  user-chosen. It is the key-confirmation IKM and **never reaches the server**.
- **Rendezvous**: a **high-entropy token** (`codeType=token`) — the server allocates a 128-bit
  CSPRNG, base64url, 22-char token (`server/signaling-server.js` `tokenCode`, `TOKEN_ROOM_BYTES=16`),
  NOT the 4-digit room. The link already carries the rendezvous, so a high-entropy token costs nothing
  in UX while making the rendezvous **unguessable**: a stranger can't enumerate/squat a token room the
  way the 10k 4-digit space can be scanned, so interloper-resistance is **structural** (the old
  link/qr lobby-race is closed by construction, not just by rate-limit). Public routing only. The
  **room method keeps the 4-digit code; words keeps its word**; only link/qr moved to the token.
- **Link shape**: `<origin>/#<token>.<S>` (`buildLinkUrl`). The token is PUBLIC (routing); S rides in
  the **fragment**, which browsers never send to the server. Both halves are base64url with no
  padding, so neither contains `.` and `parseLink` splits cleanly on the first `.`.
- **Authentication = channel-bound key-confirmation over S** (reuses `keyConfirmation.ts`, the same
  primitive + lv-canonicalisation as words/SAS, under the **`LINK_CONFIRM_DOMAIN`** domain —
  `confKey = HKDF-SHA512(S, salt=∅, info="hushsend/link/confirm")`, `tag = HMAC-SHA256(confKey,
  lv(label) || lv(fp_min) || lv(fp_max) || lv(role))`). Tags exchanged over the existing
  `{kind:'confirm', tag}` DataChannel control message; verify with `equalBytes` → `connected`;
  mismatch (no S / wrong S / MITM with different certs) → `failed`, **no byte**. The words domain
  is unchanged — `makeConfirmation`/`verifyConfirmation` gained an optional trailing `domain` arg
  that defaults to `CPACE_CONFIRM_DOMAIN`, so the words call sites are byte-for-byte identical.
- **Flow** (maps onto existing states, no new ones): A `create=1` → `awaitingPeer` shows the link
  (creator only; surfaced as `credential[0]`, same as words surfaces its secret words) → `peer-joined`
  → at pairing start the WebRTC **initiator is the smaller readable id** (see **Per-pairing role**;
  either side may offer, not necessarily the creator) → DTLS → key-confirmation over S → `connected`.
  (`creating`/`joining` → `pairing`[DTLS] → `confirming`[S key-confirm] → `connected`|`failed`.)
- **One-time / replay**: the link/QR is for ONE connection; the token room is session-scoped (TTL +
  per-IP rate-limit — the managed-room hardening — see room/SAS § *Server cap / TTL / rate-limit*).
  The token room is **strictly 1:1** (`ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS = 2`, like words), NOT the 4-digit lobby:
  the unguessable token keeps strangers OUT structurally, and the cap-2 guarantees a **single
  receiver** even if the link is forwarded (a 2nd joiner is bounced **4002 `'room full'`**; S would
  also fail key-confirmation for it — defense in depth). Its TTL is armed **from CREATE** and never
  re-armed (`TOKEN_ROOM_TTL_MS = 180000`, the natural pre-connect wait of a 1:1 link). Replay is closed
  by a fresh DTLS cert per session **plus** S being single-use (scrubbed after read).
- **Fragment scrub**: the joiner reads `location.hash` on page load, extracts the token + S, **scrubs
  the fragment immediately** via `history.replaceState` (before any await — see `LinkFragmentJoin`
  in `App.tsx`), and sends only the token to the server (`join`, `codeType=token`). A malformed/absent
  fragment is a no-op (stay home); a valid-but-dead room surfaces later as the "room not found"
  failure. `parseLink` validates strictly (token = `RENDEZVOUS_TOKEN_LEN`=22 base64url chars, S decodes
  to exactly 16 bytes) — the input is attacker-influenced; an old 4-digit-style code is now rejected.
- **qr**: the SAME link, rendered to an SVG QR locally (`src/ui/qr.ts`, `qrcode`); the joiner SCANS
  it with the camera (`getUserMedia` + the `barcode-detector` ponyfill — native `BarcodeDetector`,
  else **self-hosted** zxing-wasm via `src/ui/zxingWasm.ts`, lazily imported) → decodes to the link →
  same join path. Camera denial/absence falls back to a **paste-the-link** input (also the
  deterministic e2e injection point). The zxing WASM is served from our own origin, not a CDN — see § QR.
- **Enrollment**: TOFU pinning runs after `connected` exactly as for words/room (method-agnostic),
  so link/qr pairs can later reconnect.

## Crypto
- **CPace** (balanced PAKE) for the words method — over `@noble/curves` ristretto255
  (+ hash-to-curve) and `@noble/hashes` SHA-512, against the CFRG test vectors
  (draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21, April 2026). Password = secret words only (rendezvous excluded).
  - Specifics: sid = fresh 16-byte nonce per session, generated by initiator and sent with
    first CPace message; both sides use it in ISK derivation. Abort conditions (per draft-21):
    invalid point, point = identity. Scalar sampling: uniform ≤ 2^252 < ristretto255 order,
    rejection-sample for nonzero (negligible bias; ~2^-127).
- **Ed25519 identity key** (TOFU pinning + reconnect signatures): prefer WebCrypto
  non-extractable Ed25519 (private key never in the JS heap; the non-extractable `CryptoKey` is
  stored in IndexedDB and cannot be read back); fall back to `@noble/curves` Ed25519 (stores the
  32-byte seed) where unsupported. Signatures interoperate across both paths — verify uses noble
  unconditionally (Ed25519 is RFC 8032, signature format is canonical).
- **Identity enrollment (TOFU, done)**: runs ONLY after `connected` — i.e. over the already
  SAS/words-authenticated channel, where the MITM is already defeated, so exchanging public keys
  is trustworthy (this is the trust-on-first-use moment). It is an action on `connected`, NOT an
  FSM state, and does NOT gate `connected` or transfer; a bad enrollment signature only skips the
  pin + warns, never tears down the human/PAKE-authenticated session. The initiator (the
  **per-pairing role** — the smaller readable id, NOT necessarily the creator) generates a
  key-independent random `pairingId` (16 bytes) — key-independent so a swapped key under the same
  id is detectable on reconnect; `lv(role)` below is that per-pairing role. Each side signs its OWN
  public key:
```
  sign( lv("hushsend/identity/enroll") || lv(pairingId) || lv(ownPubKey) || lv(fp_min) || lv(fp_max) || lv(role) )
```
  (same `lv` + sorted-fingerprint canonicalization as key-confirmation / SAS; fingerprints from
  the parsed SDP — channel binding). The verifier reconstructs with the received key as the
  signer's `ownPubKey`, the peer's role, the shared `pairingId`, and its own fingerprints. On
  success each side pins `pairingId → peerPublicKey`. Frames (`enroll-init {pairingId, pubKey,
  sig}`, `enroll-ack {pubKey, sig}`) are zod-validated to exact lengths (pairingId 16B, pubKey
  32B, sig 64B).
- **Reconnect (TOFU re-auth, done — 4b-ii)**: when both sides ALREADY hold a pin for the same
  `pairingId` (from a prior enrollment), they reconnect with **NO human step** — a mutual signature
  under the pinned keys replaces SAS/words. It reuses the room rendezvous and rides on top of the
  SAS state, which stays primed as the fallback. Path selection: the initiator announces the
  pairingId (`reconnect-init`); both look up their pin. Both-have-pin → reconnect-auth; a pin
  missing on either side → `reconnect-fallback` → the normal first connect (SAS + enrollment).
  **Reconnect's `role` is the EXCEPTION to the per-pairing rule: it stays create/join** (creator =
  reconnect initiator = the side that announces the pairingId and is the verifier-first), NOT the
  id-derived `this.role`. This is deliberate — the verifier-first side must be fixed so a key change
  is caught before a forger can settle; reconnect is 1:1 creator↔joiner (mesh reconnect is a later
  step). `lv(role)` in the transcript below uses this reconnect role.
  Each side proves possession of its pinned private key over a fresh, channel-bound transcript:
```
  sign( lv("hushsend/identity/reconnect") || lv(pairingId) || lv(challengeInitiator) || lv(challengeResponder) || lv(fp_min) || lv(fp_max) || lv(role) )
```
  (same `lv` + sorted-fingerprint canonicalization as enroll/SAS/key-confirmation; fingerprints
  from the parsed SDP — channel binding. Each side draws a fresh 16-byte CSPRNG challenge; both are
  bound in fixed role order.) **Verification is TWO separate checks** so a key change is told apart
  from a MITM: (1) does the PRESENTED key equal the PINNED key for this pairingId? No → **key
  changed** hard stop (SSH-style — the peer under this id is using a different key; a visible stop,
  never a toast, no bytes). (2) does the signature verify under the PINNED key over the transcript
  rebuilt with OUR fingerprints + the peer's role? No (key matched) → channel-binding / **MITM**
  hard stop, no bytes. Both pass → authenticated reconnect (`connected`, no re-enrollment).
  **Replay** is closed by the channel binding (a fresh DTLS cert per session) AND the explicit
  challenges (so freshness does not rely on assuming the cert is fresh). Frames (`reconnect-init
  {pairingId, challenge}`, `reconnect-proof {challenge, pubKey, sig}`, `reconnect-fallback {}`) are
  zod-validated to exact lengths (pairingId 16B, challenge 16B, pubKey 32B, sig 64B). DEV/TEST knob
  `?forgeReconnectKey=1` makes a side present a fresh key under the real pairingId, driving the
  key-changed e2e.
- **Keystore** (IndexedDB, behind a `KeystoreBackend` port — an IndexedDB impl for the app, an
  in-memory impl for unit tests): stores own identity (non-extractable `CryptoKey` or noble seed)
  and pinned peer keys (`pairingId → { peerPublicKey, firstSeen, label? }`). Pinning on first
  successful connect (enrollment, above) and the **"key changed" hard stop on reconnect** (presented
  key ≠ pin → abort, never silent — `presentedKeyMatchesPin`) are both **done** (4b-i / 4b-ii).
- **Key-confirmation / channel binding**: each side derives `confKey = HKDF-SHA512(secret,
  info=domain)`, then `tag = HMAC-SHA256(confKey, lv(label) || lv(fp_min) || lv(fp_max) ||
  lv(role))`, where `fp_min/fp_max` are the DTLS fingerprints (lexicographically sorted) from the
  local cert and the received SDP; `lv` = length-prefixed encoding (same as in CPace); role = the
  **per-pairing** initiator/responder (smaller readable id = initiator, see **Per-pairing role**).
  Exchange `tag` over a DataChannel control message; verify with `equalBytes`
  (constant-time). This binds both the shared secret AND the actual DTLS channel (via fingerprints)
  — a MITM with different certs on each leg produces mismatched tags. The construction is
  **domain-parameterised** (`makeConfirmation`/`verifyConfirmation` take a `ConfirmationDomain`
  defaulting to `CPACE_CONFIRM_DOMAIN`): the **words** method feeds the CPace ISK under
  `info="hushsend/cpace/confirm"`; the **link/qr** methods feed the URL-fragment secret S under
  `LINK_CONFIRM_DOMAIN` (`info="hushsend/link/confirm"`). Same primitive + lv-canonicalisation; the
  distinct domains keep the two methods' tags independent and the words tags byte-for-byte unchanged.

## File transfer
- DataChannel with chunking + **backpressure** (`bufferedAmount` /
  `bufferedAmountLowThreshold`).
- Save-to-disk: **File System Access** (`showSaveFilePicker`) to stream to disk where
  available (Chromium); fall back to in-memory **Blob** on iOS Safari / Firefox (RAM-bound).
  Cap very large files on the Blob path — multi-GB streaming-to-disk is unreliable on iOS
  (platform limit). The transfer itself works on all browsers.

## Privacy mode + ICE (Max-privacy / Reliable — step 6d, DONE)
The home **"Max privacy" toggle is FUNCTIONAL** and drives the WebRTC `iceServers` (the only transport
behaviour behind it). It is a persisted UI pref (`prefs.tsx`, `hushsend.privacy`, **default `max`**),
pushed into the core via `<PrivacyModeSync>` (App) → `SessionController.setPrivacyMode`. The mode is
**read at pairing start** (when `iceServers` are assembled), so flipping it mid-session affects the
**NEXT** connection, NOT the live one. A LIVE Max-privacy ICE failure escalating to a relay on the fly
is the **relax-retry** strict model — now DONE (see **relax-retry (strict model)** below).
- **Builder** (`src/core/iceServers.ts`, pure + unit-tested in `iceServers.test.ts`):
  `buildIceServers({mode, stunUrls, turn})`.
  - **Max-privacy (`max`, default)**: `iceServers = [{urls: <STUN>}]` (or `[]` if no STUN) — **STUN
    only, NO TURN, and creds are NEVER requested** (the relay is never contacted; the peer sees your IP).
  - **Reliable (`reliable`)**: `[{urls: <STUN>}, {urls: <TURN urls>, username, credential}]` — STUN +
    TURN, so a pair that can't connect directly relays through coturn (your IP stays hidden from the
    peer; the relay only carries E2E-encrypted bytes). TURN is added **ONLY when the fetched `urls` is
    non-empty** — empty urls (TURN undeployed) ⇒ STUN-only (we IGNORE username/credential then; relay
    availability is keyed off `urls.length`, never off a credential being present).
- **STUN config**: build-time `VITE_STUN_URLS` (comma-separated → array; `parseStunUrls`). Empty in
  dev/test = no STUN (two loopback tabs use host candidates).
- **Cred fetch (Reliable only)**: `SignalingClient.requestTurnCredentials()` sends `{type:'turn-request'}`
  and awaits the zod-validated `{type:'turn-credentials', urls, username, credential, ttl}` reply (the
  untrusted relay — validated before use). Fetched **after** the WS is up (`welcome` arrived) and
  **before** the PeerConnection is created, so TURN is in `iceServers` from the first ICE candidate:
  `SessionController.ensureTurnReady()` is kicked off at the START of `beginPairing` (runs in parallel
  with CPace/SAS) and `startPeer` awaits the SAME memoized fetch before building the PC. Never throws —
  a closed socket / timeout / absent relay resolves to **NO_TURN (empty urls)** → direct-only. Creds are
  reset per session (`openSignaling`) since they are bound to the live socket. The built ICE config is
  published to the DEV diagnostics (`dev.iceConfig` — mode/relay/urls/username/credential) for the e2e.
- **Tests**: `iceServers.test.ts` (builder: max→STUN-only/empty, max ignores TURN, reliable+creds→STUN+TURN,
  reliable+empty-urls→STUN-only, default=max never relays); `tests/e2e/privacy.spec.ts` (toggle renders +
  flips + default max; Max-privacy still connects directly with no TURN; Reliable fetches creds via
  `turn-request` and assembles a correct TURN iceServer — the relay itself is not run, both modes connect
  over loopback). Server `turn-credentials` minting is **done (6d server side)** — see Signaling server §.

### relax-retry (strict model — done, completes 6d)
**Max-privacy NEVER relays without consent.** The strict model enforces this bilaterally, then offers a
human-consented escalation to a relay when a direct connection fails. Pure state machine + the
candidate predicate live in **`src/core/relax.ts`** (`relax.test.ts`); the live wiring (PeerConnection
+ signaling) is in `SessionController`. **No new FSM state** — status stays `pairing`; a projection
`connection.relax = { available, localRelaxed, peerRelaxed }` drives the UI.
- **Strict relay-candidate filter**: in Max-privacy (not yet relaxed) the PeerConnection **DROPS the
  peer's incoming `typ relay` ICE candidates** (`PeerConnection.addIce` → `shouldDropCandidate` /
  `isRelayCandidate`). Combined with Max-privacy never requesting local TURN (B1), this means we cannot
  be relayed **either locally or via the peer's relay** without consent. In Reliable, or after WE relax,
  filtering is off (`setRelayFilter(false)`).
- **ICE-fail → offer relax**: an ICE failure (`iceconnectionstatechange`/`connectionstatechange` →
  `failed`) WHILE filtering routes to `onIceFailed` (NOT the hard-close `onClose`); SessionController
  sets `relax.available` and the connecting screen shows the relay offer. (In Reliable / already-relaxed,
  ICE failure is a genuine `onClose` → `failed`.) A peer's relax signal ALSO surfaces the offer to us
  (`relax.available`) so we never relay silently.
- **Relax flow (each side consents; restart only when BOTH relaxed)**: a `relax` **signaling** frame
  (`{kind:'relax'}`, over the relay — NOT the DataChannel, which never opened) is exchanged between the
  paired peers (`from === peerId`, routed after the 1:1 gate like cpace/sas). On OUR accept
  (`relaxConnection`): `localRelaxed = true`; fetch coturn creds (the B1 fetch, **forced** even in
  Max-privacy); `pc.setConfiguration(STUN+TURN)`; `setRelayFilter(false)`; send `relax` to the peer. On
  RECEIVING `relax`: `peerRelaxed = true`. **Restart rule** (`shouldRestartForRelay`): when
  `localRelaxed && peerRelaxed` AND we are the **per-pairing initiator** → `pc.restartIce()`
  (`createOffer({iceRestart:true})`) → the relay path renegotiates. A one-sided relax is useless (the
  other side is still filtering) → **self-enforcing bilateral**. Decline → `failed` (we'd rather not
  connect than relay without consent), no auto-retry.
- **Restart preserves DTLS fingerprint + SAS binding (critical)**: the ICE restart is on the **EXISTING**
  PeerConnection (`setConfiguration` + `createOffer({iceRestart:true})`) — **no teardown, no new
  certificate** → the DTLS fingerprint is stable → the SAS / key-confirmation channel binding
  (`fp_min`/`fp_max`) survives. The pairing/SAS state (nonces, derived SAS) is NOT reset; only ICE
  restarts. **SAS is confirmed exactly ONCE, already over the relay** — ICE fails before the
  DataChannel / `sas-confirm`, so the SAS is never re-negotiated. If the relay restart also fails →
  `failed` (no further auto-retry).
- **Pre-SAS deadline RE-ARM when the relay offer surfaces (room method robustness)**: surfacing the
  relay offer (`onIceFailed` sets `relax.available`) opens a human-in-the-loop bilateral escalation —
  each side must SEE the offer, accept, then ICE-restart + relay-connect — that legitimately runs
  LONGER than the original pre-SAS pairing window (a single ICE-failure detection alone can eat
  ~15–30 s). So on the room/SAS path, when the offer is shown AND the SAS has not yet surfaced (it
  hasn't — ICE fails before the DataChannel opens, so no fingerprints / no SAS yet), `onIceFailed`
  **RE-ARMS the pre-SAS deadline** (`armSasTimeout('SAS pairing timed out', preSasTimeoutMs())`) to
  grant a fresh window for accept + restart + relay-connect. SAFE to extend: it is a **liveness** bound,
  not a security one (the SAS hasn't happened), the escalation is ACTIVE (not a stall), and the deadline
  STILL fires if the relax is never accepted/completed (a hung relax fails, just later). The re-arm is
  guarded to the PRE-SAS window (`this.sas && !this.sas.surfaced`) so it can't clobber the comparison
  timer, and is a NO-OP off the SAS path (words/link/qr have no `this.sas`) — the non-relax / non-SAS
  paths are untouched.
- **DEV/TEST knob**: `?forceIceFail=1` (DEV-gated, like `forgeReconnectKey`) makes the PeerConnection
  treat ICE as failed AND suppress its own candidates, driving the relax flow in e2e without a real
  network failure.
- **Tests**: `relax.test.ts` (filter drops relay only while filtering; state machine — restart only
  when both relaxed AND initiator); `connectionSlice.test.ts` (relax projection + pairing/lobby resets);
  `tests/e2e/relax.spec.ts` (`forceIceFail` Max-privacy → offer appears; decline → `failed`; accept →
  relax signal reaches the peer). The relay actually carrying bytes needs coturn → **verified at deploy**.

## QR (built — step 5b; WASM self-hosted — step 6e)
`barcode-detector` + `qrcode` are installed. Generation: `qrcode` → an SVG QR rendered locally
(`src/ui/qr.ts`, dark-on-light so it scans in either theme). Scanning: `getUserMedia` for the
camera + the **`barcode-detector` ponyfill** (native `BarcodeDetector` where available, zxing-wasm
fallback) so one path works on iOS/Firefox/everywhere; the ponyfill is **lazily imported** so its
WASM never loads unless the user actually scans. Camera denial/absence falls back to a paste-the-link
input (`src/ui/screens/ScanScreen.tsx`).
- **Self-hosted WASM (no CDN — step 6e):** the zxing reader `.wasm` (the fallback decoder on
  iOS/Firefox) is **vendored into the build** and served from our OWN origin — it is NEVER fetched
  from a third-party CDN. `barcode-detector@3.2.0`'s default Emscripten `locateFile` would pull
  `zxing_reader.wasm` from `fastly.jsdelivr.net` at scan time (leaking the client IP + executing
  WASM from a host we don't control — a privacy + supply-chain risk). `src/ui/zxingWasm.ts`
  (`createQrDetector`) overrides it: it `import`s the `.wasm` as a Vite **`?url` asset**
  (`zxing-wasm/reader/zxing_reader.wasm?url` → fingerprinted into `dist/assets/`, same-origin) and
  calls `setZXingModuleOverrides({ locateFile })` to point the loader at that asset **before** the
  detector instantiates. Lazy loading is preserved (only the URL string is in the bundle; the
  ponyfill JS + WASM still load only on a real scan, now from `'self'`). `zxing-wasm@3.1.0` is pinned
  as a direct dep (exact, matching barcode-detector's inlined copy) so the import resolves
  independent of hoisting. The wired `locateFile` is unit-tested in `zxingWasm.test.ts` (resolves to
  a same-origin asset, never jsdelivr/fastly). ScanScreen calls `createQrDetector()` instead of
  constructing the ponyfill detector directly. **CSP consequence:** `connect-src` no longer lists any
  CDN (see § Deployment).
- **⚠️ Version-coupling — re-check the `zxing-wasm` pin on every `barcode-detector` bump.** Our direct
  `zxing-wasm@3.1.0` pin MUST stay equal to the version `barcode-detector` inlines internally: at scan
  time the ponyfill's JS expects a `zxing_reader.wasm` whose ABI matches ITS inlined copy, but
  `locateFile` now points the loader at OUR vendored asset. If a future `barcode-detector` upgrade
  silently inlines a DIFFERENT zxing-wasm version, our vendored `.wasm` would be ABI-mismatched against
  the loader JS → the QR-scan FALLBACK breaks **at runtime on iOS/Firefox** (the `.wasm` import still
  resolves and the build still passes — the mismatch is invisible to `tsc`/`vite build`, and Chromium's
  native `BarcodeDetector` path masks it in most dev/CI). So when bumping `barcode-detector`, re-verify
  the exact zxing-wasm version it inlines (e.g. inspect its `package.json`/lockfile entry) and move our
  direct `zxing-wasm` pin to match in the SAME pass, then re-run `zxingWasm.test.ts` and a real
  non-Chromium scan. Keep both pins EXACT (no `^`/`~`).

## UI / styling — stark-ui-kit (required)
Install: `npm install github:maksimfrelikh/stark-ui-kit`.
- Import `stark-ui-kit/styles.css` once, at the app root (`src/main.tsx`).
- **Strictly MONOCHROME — there is NO accent colour.** Emphasis / selected / danger is the single
  ink-INVERSION language: `--ink` (the strong ink) on `--ink-fg` (text on ink). Do not add any
  colour/accent token, ever.
- **Theme is switched via `[data-theme]` on `<html>`** (light is the default; `[data-theme="dark"]`
  is opt-in — `prefs.tsx` reflects the choice). The monochrome light/dark palette lives in
  `src/ui/theme.css` and is consumed by the kit; the app never introduces new colour/spacing/radius
  scales.
- **Build ALL styling on the kit's real tokens** (do not invent scales): semantic colours
  `--bg` / `--fg` / `--muted` / `--faint` / `--line` / `--line-2` / `--ink` / `--ink-fg`;
  radii `--r-*`; typography `--t-*` + weight / label tokens; fonts `--font-grotesk` / `--font-mono`;
  spacing `--gut` / `--maxw` / `--scale`; motion `--ease-*` / `--dur-*`. (These are the ACTUAL kit
  names — NOT the prototype's `--line2` / `--inkfg` / `--sans`.)
- For focus-trap, scroll-lock, and copy-to-clipboard use the kit's hooks/utilities —
  `useFocusTrap`, `useScrollLock`, `copyToClipboard` — do not reimplement.
- The kit ships **tokens + a11y base CSS + headless hooks ONLY (no React components).** Screens are
  composed from the app component layer in `src/ui/app.css` (classes prefixed `.hs-*`, all built on
  the kit tokens above), imported in `src/main.tsx` AFTER the kit base + `theme.css`.
- Build screens against the Claude Design mockups in `uploads/design-reference/` (HTML prototype
  + screenshots; bilingual EN/RU). Design priority: **the kit is the source of truth**; mockups are
  reference for layout/flow/copy — where they conflict with kit components/tokens, the kit wins.

## Signaling server (`server/signaling-server.js`)
Self-contained Node + `ws`; PURE signaling, never carries file data. Already corrected:
`clientIp()` reads `X-Real-IP` (set by nginx), not the client-controllable leftmost
X-Forwarded-For; binds to `127.0.0.1` (only the local nginx reaches it). Run with
`TRUST_PROXY=1` behind nginx.
- Frontend (static `dist/`) and the WS share one host behind nginx; nginx must set
  `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;` and proxy the WS (e.g. `location /ws`) to
  `127.0.0.1:8080`. Client connects to `wss://<host>/ws?app=filetransfer&…`.
- **Lobby roster protocol (step 6c)**: `welcome.peers` and `peer-joined` now carry the room roster as
  `{id, device, joinedAt}` (was a bare id / `{peerId}`). `device` is a COARSE cosmetic label the client
  sends on connect (query `?device=` — e.g. `Desktop`/`Mobile`, never a full UA); the server strips
  control chars + **caps it ≤32** (untrusted, cosmetic — the SAS authenticates) and **stamps `joinedAt`
  on its own clock**. `peer-left` is unchanged (`{peerId}`). The client validates the new shape with
  zod (`peerInfoSchema`) before it reaches the store. Used only for the room mesh-lobby roster UI.
- **codeType allocation (`codeSpec`)**: the server resolves a per-connection `codeType` to a
  validator + allocator. THREE codeTypes for `filetransfer`: **''** (default, 4-digit `code`/`allocate`
  — the ROOM method); **`word`** (server keeps its own EFF short #2 copy, allocates a rendezvous word
  via the same collision-retry loop, validates membership on join — the WORDS method); **`token`** (a
  128-bit CSPRNG base64url token, `TOKEN_ROOM_BYTES=16` → 22 chars, allocated via `randomBytes` +
  `allocateCode`, validated by `TOKEN_RE` strict format/length on join — the link/QR method). The
  client selects via `?codeType=word` / `?codeType=token`. Word/token rooms expire on TTL or
  cap-reached; freed words return to the pool.
- **Managed-room hardening (all codeTypes — done in 6a; token added pre-deploy)**: the `filetransfer`
  app is flagged **`managed: true`**, which governs the TTL + per-IP rate-limit for ALL its rooms
  (4-digit, word, token). The **seat cap is a SEPARATE, codeType-dependent decision** (`managed` ≠ 1:1):
  - **Seat cap (codeType-dependent)** — `const maxPeers = is1to1 ? ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS : cfg.maxPeers`,
    where `is1to1 = isWordRoom || isTokenRoom` (`isWordRoom = codeType==='word' && !!cfg.wordCode`;
    `isTokenRoom = codeType==='token' && !!cfg.tokenCode`). The 4-digit ROOM rendezvous is a **LOBBY**
    of `cfg.maxPeers` (`FILETRANSFER_MAX_PEERS`, default **8**) — several peers see each other and each
    picks whom to open a 1:1 channel with; the **words AND link/QR token** rendezvous are strictly 1:1
    (`ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS = 2`) — words so secret-word guessing stays serialized, token so a forwarded
    one-time link still reaches a SINGLE receiver. A joiner past the cap is bounced with close
    **4002 `'room full'`** (the room-full check runs before the per-IP-per-room cap). (The `clipboard`
    mesh has no `wordCode`/`tokenCode` → `is1to1` is always false → it keeps its own `cfg.maxPeers`
    lobby, unchanged.)
  - **TTL until connected** — `closeRoom(key,'expired')` notifies members (`{type:'room-closed'}`),
    closes their sockets (**4010**), and FREES the code (a later join → **4009 `'room not found'`**),
    via the extracted `makeTtlTimer(key, ttlMs)` (unref'd). The **4-digit lobby uses an IDLE timeout**
    (`ROOM_TTL_MS`, default **180000** ~3 min): armed on CREATE and **re-armed on every JOIN** (only
    when `cfg.managed && !is1to1`), so an actively-joined lobby lives while a stale one expires.
    The **1:1 words AND token rooms arm their TTL once at CREATE and NEVER re-arm** (`WORD_ROOM_TTL_MS`
    / `TOKEN_ROOM_TTL_MS`, default 180000) — a re-arm would let an attacker keep a 1:1 room alive by
    rejoining (for words it would also defeat the guessing bound). All env-overridable. The creator may
    also tear down early via `{type:'destroy'}`
    (reason `'destroyed'`). After `connected`, closing signaling does NOT drop the live P2P channel —
    the TTL only bounds the pre-connection rendezvous window (client treats the close as benign once
    `established`).
  - **Per-IP create/join rate-limit** — UNCHANGED. Fixed window keyed on `clientIp()`: `IP_RL_MAX =
    60` attempts per `IP_RL_WINDOW_MS = 60000` (both env-overridable). Over budget → close **4011 `'too
    many attempts'`** (counts failed joins too, so it bounds enumeration of the 10k space). **Loopback
    is EXEMPT** (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) — behind nginx a real client always arrives via `X-Real-IP` and
    never looks like loopback, so the local proxy / dev / e2e are never throttled. Defense-in-depth
    only; SAS / key-confirmation are what actually stop a MITM. (`tests/integration/room-server.test.ts`.)
  - The `clipboard` mesh app is NOT `managed` — it keeps its shared-code mesh (`maxPeers` lobby, no
    TTL, no rate-limit), since those are one user's own devices typing the same code on purpose.
- **TURN credentials for Reliable mode (server side — done; client side — done incl. relax-retry, see
  Privacy mode + ICE §)**: the server
  answers a **`turn-request`** frame with short-lived, HMAC-derived **coturn** credentials
  (`use-auth-secret` / "REST API" scheme) so a 1:1 pair that can't connect directly can fall back to
  a relay. Gated on **`cfg.managed`** (the `filetransfer` rendezvous only; `clipboard` has no server
  fallback). The reply is `{type:'turn-credentials', urls, username, credential, ttl}` where
  `username = String(floor(now/1000) + TURN_CRED_TTL_S)` (a FUTURE unix-expiry) and
  `credential = base64(HMAC-SHA1(TURN_SECRET, username))`. **coturn recomputes the same HMAC and
  enforces the embedded expiry**, so there is NO signaling↔coturn round-trip. The **`TURN_SECRET` is
  shared with coturn's `static-auth-secret` and lives ONLY on the server — it is NEVER sent to the
  client**; only the derived per-session credential leaves the process. **Graceful when unconfigured**:
  empty `TURN_SECRET` (or a non-managed app) → reply with **empty `urls`** (`{urls:[], username:'',
  credential:'', ttl:0}`) → the client treats relay as unavailable and stays **direct-only**
  (= Max-privacy). The handler is bounded by the **existing per-socket message rate-limit** (no
  separate limiter). Env: `TURN_SECRET` (server-only shared secret), `TURN_URLS` (comma-separated
  `turn:`/`turns:` URIs → array), `TURN_CRED_TTL_S` (default **3600**). **coturn is deployed
  SEPARATELY** — template + line-by-line hardening (open relay-port range + firewall, `user-quota` /
  `total-quota` / `max-bps`, anti-SSRF `no-multicast-peers` / `no-loopback-peers` / `denied-peer-ip`
  on RFC1918 + link-local, `fingerprint`, `no-cli`) in **`deploy/coturn.conf.example`**. The client
  side (the functional toggle, `requestTurnCredentials`, feeding `iceServers`, Max-privacy never
  requests) is **done** — see **Privacy mode + ICE** §; **relax-retry** (a live Max-privacy ICE failure
  escalating to relay, both sides consenting) is also **done** — see **relax-retry (strict model)** there.
  (`tests/integration/turn-credentials.test.ts`.)

## Deployment / configuration (step 6f — artifacts ready; live deploy is ops)
One place that ties together every knob needed to run a live instance. The **artifacts** are built
and committed — `deploy/nginx.conf.example`, `server/.env.example`, `deploy/coturn.conf.example`,
and the step-by-step `deploy/DEPLOY.md`; the only code change for 6f is an **additive startup
`[config]` summary log** (no secrets) in `signaling-server.js`. The live deploy itself (nginx/coturn/
DNS/TLS on real hosts) is ops — these are what it consumes. Config lives in three layers:
- **Client build-time (`VITE_*`, baked by Vite — no runtime client config):** `VITE_SIGNALING_URL`
  (the `wss://hushsend.frelikh.dev/ws` the client opens — nginx proxies `/ws` → Node) and
  **`VITE_STUN_URLS`** (coturn STUN endpoint(s)). **`VITE_STUN_URLS` is REQUIRED for a real deploy** —
  Max-privacy (the default) is STUN-only, so with it empty two cross-network peers have no ICE server
  and never connect (loopback tabs hide this in dev). Changing either means a **rebuild**, not an
  nginx edit; `VITE_SIGNALING_URL`'s host must match the CSP `connect-src` in the nginx template.
- **Server env (`server/.env.example`):** `HOST`/`PORT` (loopback `127.0.0.1:8080` behind nginx),
  **`TRUST_PROXY=1` (mandatory behind nginx)**, TURN (`TURN_SECRET` / `TURN_URLS` / `TURN_CRED_TTL_S`),
  and the tunable caps/TTLs/rate-limits (`MAX_CONNS_*`, `FILETRANSFER_MAX_PEERS`, `ROOM_TTL_MS` /
  `WORD_ROOM_TTL_MS` / `TOKEN_ROOM_TTL_MS`, `IP_RL_MAX` / `IP_RL_WINDOW_MS`, message-rate knobs). **`TRUST_PROXY=1` +
  nginx `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;` are a pair and the #1 footgun:** without both,
  `clientIp()` sees only loopback → per-IP caps collapse onto one bucket and the 4011 rate-limit
  (loopback-exempt) silently disables. **Shared-NAT note:** clients behind one public IP divide
  `IP_RL_MAX` per window → raise it for office/CGNAT deploys (defense-in-depth only — SAS stops a
  MITM). The startup `[config]` log echoes the effective values (TRUST_PROXY, TURN configured/count,
  caps, TTLs, IP_RL_MAX) **without secrets** — eyeball it after each restart.
- **coturn (`deploy/coturn.conf.example`, separate host):** `static-auth-secret` **MUST EQUAL** the
  server's `TURN_SECRET` (the one shared secret; coturn recomputes the HMAC offline). Empty
  `TURN_SECRET` ⇒ relay disabled ⇒ clients stay direct-only (a valid config). Open the firewall for
  3478 udp/tcp, 5349 tls, and the relay-port range.
- **Cross-dependencies:** `TURN_SECRET` == coturn `static-auth-secret`; `VITE_STUN_URLS` + `TURN_URLS`
  both name the **coturn host** (DNS: `hushsend.frelikh.dev` → web host, `turn.hushsend.frelikh.dev`
  → coturn). **CSP must be verified against the built app — especially the QR-scan path** (zxing WASM
  needs `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` to COMPILE on iOS/Firefox; the WASM itself is **self-hosted** since step
  6e — vendored into `dist/assets`, served from `'self'` — so `connect-src` is `'self' wss://<host>`
  only, **no CDN**; camera needs `Permissions-Policy: camera=(self)`); see the CSP comment block in
  `deploy/nginx.conf.example` and the smoke-test gotcha in `deploy/DEPLOY.md`. **See `deploy/` for the
  templates + runbook.**

## Build order (completed / in progress / planned)
1. ✅ **Transport** — `SignalingClient`, `PeerConnection`, core DataChannel backbone.
2. ✅ **File transfer** — chunking, backpressure, FSA/Blob caps.
3. ✅ **words path** — wordlist (EFF short #2, programmatic), `generateWords` (CSPRNG);
   `cpace` (CFRG draft-21 vectors, ristretto255+SHA512); `keyConfirmation` (ISK→HMAC, channel
   binding); rate-limit (≤10 attempts); TTL (3 min, does not tear down live P2P).
4. **room + SAS, then Identity + TOFU**:
   - ✅ **4a — room + SAS** — 4-digit code, commit-before-reveal, SAS = 3 words, fingerprint
     binding, mutual confirmation over DataChannel, pre-SAS + comparison timeouts, zod length
     checks. (Server cap/TTL/rate-limit for 4-digit rooms is **done — step 6a**, below.)
   - ✅ **4b — Identity + TOFU** — two parts:
     - **4b-i** — Ed25519 identity key + IndexedDB keystore + TOFU **enrollment** (pin peer key
       on first successful connect, channel-bound).
     - **4b-ii** — **reconnect**: mutual challenge-response signatures (channel-bound, replay-
       resistant) under the pinned keys; two-check verify (key-changed vs MITM) + "key changed" hard
       stop; falls back to SAS + enrollment when a pin is missing. `reconnect.ts` + e2e (happy +
       key-changed).
5. **Real UI screens** — kit-based, status-driven screens (no router), persistent state across
   tabs / reload.
   - ✅ **5a (this step)** — real screens for the existing methods: home (method select + recent
     devices), room create/join, words create/join (5-slot autocomplete picker), **SAS as an
     ASYMMETRIC "pick from 3 phrases"** (per-pairing by id: the smaller-id side reads its phrase, the
     other is the blind picker), reconnect (pinned-key → no SAS; visible key-changed hard stop),
     transfer (progress / backpressure / FSA-Blob / cancel), failed/error screens, light-dark +
     EN/RU. Dev harness removed; a DEV-only diagnostics strip (tree-shaken from prod) carries the
     test-observable projections. **Recent devices are read from the keystore** (`recentDevices.ts`
     → `listPins()`) — the single source of pins/keys; localStorage holds ONLY prefs (`prefs.tsx`,
     lang/theme/**privacy mode**) — no peer keys, no pairingIds, no secrets, **no transfer history**
     (history is SESSION-ONLY: in-memory Redux `historySlice`, gone on reload — see § Build order 6 /
     transfer-history privacy); "forget" clears the keystore pins AND the in-memory history. The SAS
     pick-from-3 display logic is isolated + unit-tested in `sasOptions.ts` (`sasOptions.test.ts`).
     (The Privacy/Reliable toggle was rendered disabled here in 5a; it is now FUNCTIONAL — step 6d
     client side, see **Privacy mode + ICE** §.)
   - ✅ **5b** — link + QR methods. High-entropy one-time secret S in the URL fragment
     (scrub-after-read), token rendezvous (`codeType=token` — initially a 4-digit room; replaced
     with a high-entropy token rendezvous pre-deploy, see § link/qr method), channel-bound key-confirmation over S
     (`LINK_CONFIRM_DOMAIN`) — no PAKE, no SAS. qr = the same link via `qrcode` (generate) +
     `barcode-detector` ponyfill + `getUserMedia` (scan, with a paste fallback). `src/core/link/` +
     link/qr screens + `src/ui/qr.ts` + e2e (link happy / link wrong-secret / qr post-scan).
6. **Hardening**:
   - ✅ **6a — server cap/TTL/rate-limit for `filetransfer` rooms** — `managed: true` (TTL +
     per-IP rate-limit). TTL-until-connected freeing the code (4010 close / 4009 on a later join),
     per-IP create/join rate-limit (4011, loopback-exempt). Server-only change;
     `tests/integration/room-server.test.ts`. **Correction (later pass):** the seat cap is
     codeType-dependent, NOT the `managed` flag — the 4-digit **room** rendezvous is a **mesh LOBBY**
     (`FILETRANSFER_MAX_PEERS`, default 8); the **words** AND (pre-deploy) the link/qr **token**
     rendezvous are strictly 1:1 (`ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS = 2`). The 4-digit lobby TTL is an **idle
     timeout** (re-armed on each join); the 1:1 words/token TTLs stay armed from CREATE. Also: **SAS UI
     role is now per-pairing by readable-id order**
     (`src/core/sasRole.ts`, projected as `connection.sasRole`, fail-closed restart on a missing id)
     so the lobby's joiner↔joiner pairs still get one reader + one picker. See **Signaling server**
     § *Managed-room hardening* and room/SAS § *Server cap / TTL / rate-limit* + *SAS role*.
   - ✅ **6b — per-pairing transport/crypto role** — `this.role` (initiator/responder) is now fixed
     **PER-PAIRING from the readable ids** (`src/core/pairingRole.ts` `pairingRoleFor`, same id order
     as the SAS reader/picker; unit-tested in `pairingRole.test.ts`), NOT create/join. This breaks the
     joiner↔joiner deadlock (both `responder` → no WebRTC offer + SAS commit-reveal stall) for the
     mesh lobby: the WebRTC offer, CPace init, SAS nonce/commit order, and key-confirmation/enrollment
     `lv(role)` all follow it; reconnect's protocol role stays create/join (the exception). 1:1 outcome
     unchanged. Foundation for the lobby-UI (next). See **Per-pairing role** §.
   - ✅ **6c — Room lobby UI (mesh roster + pick→connect)** — the room method no longer auto-pairs:
     creator AND joiners land in `awaitingPeer` (`joining → awaitingPeer`, no new state) and see a
     `LobbyScreen` — the 4-digit code + a roster (`connection.roster` = `{id, device, joinedAt}` from
     welcome/peer-joined) + a Connect button per peer. Pick → `pair-request`; the smaller id offers
     (per-pairing role 6b), glare/dedup handled, **busy-reject** returns the picker to the lobby with a
     clear notice (no hang). Works for ANY pair incl. **joiner↔joiner**. Signaling protocol grew:
     `welcome.peers` + `peer-joined` now carry `{id, device, joinedAt}` (coarse device label sent by
     the client, server-capped ≤32 + server-stamped joinedAt). words/link/qr are NOT lobbies (auto-pair
     with one peer); reconnect keeps the simple code screen + auto-pairs. `LobbyScreen` +
     `pickPeer`/`onPairRequest`/`onBusy`; `tests/e2e/lobby.spec.ts` (joiner↔joiner + busy),
     `connectionSlice.test.ts` (roster), `room-server.test.ts` (roster protocol). See **Room lobby** §.
     **Deferred:** reconnect-in-lobby (lobby picks always do a fresh SAS; reconnect stays a separate
     by-code path — when it gains lobby support its reconnect role must move to id-order too),
     return-to-lobby after a finished/aborted session, and link/qr lobby-race resistance — see BACKLOG.
   - ✅ **6d — TURN relay + Reliable / Max-privacy mode + relax-retry** *(DONE)* —
     **server side**: the signaling server mints short-lived HMAC coturn credentials on a
     `turn-request` frame (`use-auth-secret` scheme, `TURN_SECRET` shared with coturn + never sent to
     clients, empty-urls when unconfigured → direct-only); env `TURN_SECRET` / `TURN_URLS` /
     `TURN_CRED_TTL_S`; coturn deploy template `deploy/coturn.conf.example`;
     `tests/integration/turn-credentials.test.ts`. **Client side:** the home
     **PrivacyToggle is functional** (persisted pref, default Max-privacy) and drives `iceServers` —
     **Max-privacy = STUN-only, never requests creds; Reliable = STUN + TURN**, creds fetched via
     `requestTurnCredentials` (`turn-request`) after `welcome` + before the PC, empty-urls → direct-only.
     `src/core/iceServers.ts` (builder, `VITE_STUN_URLS` STUN config) + `iceServers.test.ts`;
     `prefs.tsx` pref + `<PrivacyModeSync>` (App) → `setPrivacyMode`; `tests/e2e/privacy.spec.ts`.
     **relax-retry (strict model, this pass):** Max-privacy NEVER relays without consent — the
     PeerConnection drops the peer's `typ relay` candidates (`src/core/relax.ts` filter), and a live ICE
     failure OFFERS a relay escalation (`connection.relax`, status stays `pairing`) instead of
     hard-failing. The relay forms only once BOTH sides relax (self-enforcing bilateral): on accept we
     fetch creds + `setConfiguration(STUN+TURN)` + stop filtering + signal the peer; the per-pairing
     initiator then `restartIce()` on the EXISTING PC (no teardown, no new cert → DTLS fingerprint + SAS
     binding preserved; SAS confirmed once, over the relay). Decline → `failed`. `src/core/relax.ts`
     (+ `relax.test.ts`), `connectionSlice` relax projection, `ConnectingScreen` relax offer/waiting,
     `?forceIceFail=1` DEV knob, `tests/e2e/relax.spec.ts`. See **Privacy mode + ICE / relax-retry** §.
   - 🚧 **6e — cross-browser pass** — the **no-device parts are DONE** (this pass): (1) the QR-scan
     WASM is **self-hosted** (vendored, served from `'self'`, no CDN — `src/ui/zxingWasm.ts`
     `createQrDetector` + `setZXingModuleOverrides` over a Vite `?url` asset; `zxingWasm.test.ts`;
     CSP CDN dropped), and (2) a **feature-detection / graceful-degradation review** confirmed every
     browser-API path degrades cleanly with a fallback/message: QR-scan (no `BarcodeDetector` →
     self-hosted zxing; camera denied/absent → paste fallback — added an explicit
     `navigator.mediaDevices?.getUserMedia` guard), file save (no FSA `showSaveFilePicker` → Blob
     fallback + size cap, rejected pre-accept), `navigator.locks` (cross-tab keystore lock → degrade
     to direct call), `navigator.share`/`crypto.subtle`/`indexedDB` (all guarded with fallbacks).
     **Remaining (after deploy, real devices):** transport + FSA→Blob + QR scan + camera permissions
     verified on actual iOS Safari / Firefox.
   - 🚧 **6f — nginx deployment (deploy-prep artifacts DONE; live deploy is ops)** — the config
     templates + runbook are built and committed: `deploy/nginx.conf.example` (TLS, 80→443, SPA
     `try_files $uri /index.html`, the `/ws` proxy with `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;` +
     WS-upgrade + raised `proxy_read_timeout`, and security headers — HSTS / a build-tuned **CSP**
     [`'wasm-unsafe-eval'` for the QR-scan WASM, now **self-hosted** so `connect-src` lists no CDN —
     step 6e] / `Permissions-Policy camera=(self)`),
     `server/.env.example` (all server env in one place), `deploy/coturn.conf.example` (from 6d), and
     `deploy/DEPLOY.md` (step-by-step + inline gotchas). The only code change was an **additive startup
     `[config]` summary log** (no secrets) in `signaling-server.js`. Consolidated env reference:
     **§ Deployment / configuration** above. **Remaining (ops, not code):** run nginx/coturn/DNS/TLS on
     real hosts; verify the CSP against the deployed build (esp. QR scan on iOS/Firefox — overlaps 6e).
     Plus nice-to-haves. (The high-entropy rendezvous for link/qr is now **done** — codeType=token,
     pre-deploy.) **Details + scope: see BACKLOG.md.**

## Current state
- ✅ `src/core/crypto/` — `cpace` (CFRG draft-21 vectors passing), `keyConfirmation` (channel
  binding + MITM tests), `sas` (commit-before-reveal, HKDF-SHA512, fingerprint binding, timeouts,
  zod length checks), `identity` (Ed25519, WebCrypto non-extractable + noble fallback),
  `enrollment` (TOFU exchange + pin, channel-bound), `reconnect` (TOFU re-auth: channel-bound
  signature under the pinned key + fresh challenges, two-check verify, key-change detection). Words
  wordlist (EFF short #2) programmatic.
- ✅ `src/core/keystore/` — IndexedDB (+ in-memory backend for unit tests) behind
  `KeystoreBackend`; own identity key + pinned peer keys (`pairingId → peer key`). Cross-tab
  identity-generation single-flight via `navigator.locks`; "key changed" detection on reconnect.
- ✅ `src/core/words/` — `generateWords` (CSPRNG, rejection-sampled), rate-limit counter (≤10
  attempts), TTL handling (does not kill live P2P).
- ✅ `src/core/link/` — `link.ts` (pure): `generateLinkSecret` (16 CSPRNG bytes, base64url),
  `buildLinkUrl` (`<origin>/#<token>.<S>`), `parseLink` (strict: 22-char base64url rendezvous TOKEN +
  16-byte S, no throw; rejects an old 4-digit code). The rendezvous is a high-entropy token
  (`RENDEZVOUS_TOKEN_BYTES = 16`), so link/qr can't be enumerated/squatted. Used by the link/qr
  methods; the secret never reaches the server. (`link.test.ts`.)
- ✅ `src/core/` — transport (SignalingClient, PeerConnection), file transfer, SessionController
  orchestration (incl. SAS + post-connect enrollment wiring + the link/qr key-confirmation-over-S
  path, step 5b). FSM in store (status, transitions, invariants enforced). The per-pairing
  transport/crypto role is fixed from the readable ids in `SessionController.beginPairing` via
  `src/core/pairingRole.ts` `pairingRoleFor` (smaller id = initiator; same id order as
  `sasRole.ts`; `pairingRole.test.ts`) — drives the WebRTC offer, CPace init, SAS nonce/commit
  order, and key-confirmation/enrollment `lv(role)`; reconnect's protocol role stays create/join.
- ✅ `src/core/relax.ts` — relax-retry STRICT model (step 6d, pure + `relax.test.ts`): the
  relay-candidate filter (`isRelayCandidate`/`shouldDropCandidate` — Max-privacy drops the peer's `typ
  relay` candidates until relaxed) + the relax state machine (`relaxOnIceFail`/`relaxOnLocal`/
  `relaxOnPeer`/`shouldRestartForRelay` — restart only when BOTH relaxed AND we are the initiator). The
  live wiring (filter in `PeerConnection.addIce`, `onIceFailed`/`relaxConnection`/`declineRelax`/
  `onRelaxSignal`/`maybeRestartForRelay`, `restartIce` on the existing PC preserving the DTLS
  fingerprint) is in PeerConnection + SessionController; `connection.relax` projects it.
- ✅ `src/ui/` — **real, status-driven screens (steps 5a + 5b)**, built on kit tokens (monochrome,
  inversion-as-emphasis, light/dark via `[data-theme]`, EN/RU). `ScreenRouter` picks a screen by
  FSM status (+ method/phase); `HomeScreen` (landing → method picker [link / qr / words / room] →
  words-receive + QR-scan-receive, recent devices, join-by-code, reconnect-by-code, **functional "Max
  privacy" / Reliable toggle** — step 6d, drives `iceServers`), `RoomCreateScreen` (reconnect create
  path — code + waiting), `LobbyScreen` (step
  6c — the room mesh lobby: code + roster [`connection.roster` id/device/joinedAt] + a Connect button
  per peer → `pickPeer`), `WordsCreateScreen`, `LinkCreateScreen` (one-time link +
  copy/share), `QrCreateScreen` (the link as an SVG QR), `ScanScreen` (qr receive: camera +
  paste-link fallback), `ConnectingScreen` (creating/joining/pairing-lobby/confirming, plus the
**relax-retry** relay offer/waiting when `connection.relax.available` — step 6d), `SasScreen`
  (**asymmetric pick-from-3**: reader shows its phrase; picker is blind among the real + 2 local
  decoys — **role per-pairing by readable-id order**, `src/core/sasRole.ts` → `connection.sasRole`,
  fail-closed "restart verification" on a missing id), `TransferScreen`, `FailedScreen`
  (+ key-changed hard stop). The link fragment auto-join + scrub lives in `App.tsx`
  (`LinkFragmentJoin`). Shared `ui.tsx` (TopBar, StatusBeacon, PrivacyToggle, CopyButton,
  ShareButton, Eyebrow, …), `components/` (`WordPicker`, DEV-only `Diagnostics`), `qr.ts`
  (link→SVG QR via `qrcode`; `qr.test.ts`), `prefs.tsx` + `i18n.ts` (lang/theme/**privacy mode**, the
  last pushed into the core via `<PrivacyModeSync>` → `setPrivacyMode`), `sasOptions.ts`
  (+ `sasOptions.test.ts`: SAS pick-from-3 decoys + scoring) over `random.ts` (CSPRNG),
  `recentDevices.ts` (recent devices read from the keystore). **Transfer history is SESSION-ONLY** —
  an in-memory Redux slice (`src/store/historySlice.ts`), NOT persisted (file names are a privacy
  trail; gone on reload). localStorage now holds **only prefs** (lang/theme/privacy mode); there is no
  longer a `persistence.ts`. The `dev` store slice stays as the auxiliary projection
  feed (identity pubkey / pinned peer / public DTLS fingerprints / **ICE config: privacy mode + relay
  + TURN creds** / log) the SessionController publishes; all fields are serializable + non-sensitive
  (RTK `serializableCheck` stays ON), and the DEV-only `Diagnostics` is what surfaces them (display
  gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV`).
- ✅ Server — signaling, corrected `clientIp()`, word + token rendezvous allocation (`codeSpec`).
  **Managed-room hardening (done — 6a)** for ALL `filetransfer` rooms (`managed: true` → TTL + per-IP
  rate-limit). **Seat cap is codeType-dependent (NOT `managed`):** the 4-digit **room** rendezvous is a
  **mesh LOBBY** (`maxPeers` = `FILETRANSFER_MAX_PEERS`, default 8); the **words** AND link/qr **token**
  rendezvous are strictly 1:1 (`ONE_TO_ONE_MAX_PEERS = 2`); a joiner past the cap → 4002. The **token**
  codeType (`tokenCode`) allocates a 128-bit base64url token (`TOKEN_ROOM_BYTES=16`, `TOKEN_RE`
  validator) so link/qr rendezvous is unguessable. **TTL until connected** frees the code
  (4010 close / 4009 later): the 4-digit lobby TTL is an **idle timeout** (`ROOM_TTL_MS`, re-armed on
  each join via `makeTtlTimer`); the 1:1 words AND token TTLs stay from CREATE (`WORD_ROOM_TTL_MS` /
  `TOKEN_ROOM_TTL_MS`, no re-arm). Per-IP
  create/join rate-limit unchanged (`IP_RL_MAX` / `IP_RL_WINDOW_MS`, 4011, loopback-exempt), creator
  destroy. `clipboard` mesh opts out. **TURN creds (6d, server side — done):** `turn-request` →
  `turn-credentials` mints short-lived HMAC coturn creds (`use-auth-secret`; `TURN_SECRET` shared with
  coturn + never sent to clients; empty-urls when unconfigured → direct-only); env `TURN_SECRET` /
  `TURN_URLS` / `TURN_CRED_TTL_S`. Ready for deployment behind nginx + a separately-deployed coturn
  (`deploy/coturn.conf.example`).
  (`tests/integration/{room,word-room,turn-credentials}-server` — see `room-server.test.ts`,
  `word-room-server.test.ts`, `turn-credentials.test.ts`.)
- ✅ `src/ui/zxingWasm.ts` — self-hosted QR-scan WASM (step 6e): `createQrDetector` lazily imports
  the `barcode-detector` ponyfill and `setZXingModuleOverrides({ locateFile })` it to a Vite `?url`
  asset (`zxing-wasm/reader/zxing_reader.wasm?url`, fingerprinted into `dist/assets`, same-origin)
  so the fallback decoder never fetches from a CDN. `zxingWasm.test.ts` proves the wired `locateFile`
  resolves to `'self'`, never jsdelivr/fastly. ScanScreen consumes it.
- 📋 Pending: step 6 — **6d DONE**; **6e no-device parts DONE** (self-hosted QR WASM +
  feature-detection review); remaining: 6e real-device test (post-deploy), 6f nginx deploy +
  follow-ups + nice-to-haves — tracked in **BACKLOG.md**.

## Known residuals / deferred
- **`pairingId` is a metadata leak to the relay** (reconnect). It is an identifier, not a secret,
  and reconnect announces it over signaling-routed setup, so the untrusted relay can observe "these
  two have paired before" (linkability across reconnects). It carries no key material and does not
  weaken the auth (the signature under the pinned key is what authenticates); it is a privacy /
  traffic-analysis residual, not a confidentiality one.
- **Dual-pin under different pairingIds if one side loses its keystore** (reconnect). If a peer
  clears storage (or the keystore is wiped) it no longer holds the pin, so the next connect falls
  back to SAS + a FRESH enrollment → a NEW pairingId. The other side keeps the stale pin AND gains
  the new one (two pins for the same human). Benign (the fresh enrollment is itself human-verified),
  but the keystore accumulates a dead pin. Not fixed (no GC / pin-merge yet).
  (Server cap/TTL/rate-limit for 4-digit rooms is **done — step 6a**; see Signaling server §
  *Managed-room hardening*.)

## Cross-cutting invariants
- No file bytes before the connection is authenticated (`connected` / `established`).
- Validate every inbound signaling frame with the zod schemas (the server is untrusted).
- Secret words / link secrets never go to the server; link secrets live in the URL fragment
  and are scrubbed after read.
- All random credential material from a CSPRNG, never user-chosen.
- After `connected`, signaling closure does not tear down the live P2P connection (enables
  long transfers and future reconnect).
