#
# Does the LIVE relay actually work end to end?
#
# `tests/integration/turn-relay.test.ts` proves the CONTRACT on every push: a credential minted by
# the signaling server opens an allocation on a coturn configured with the same secret, and one
# minted under a different secret is refused. What it cannot prove is that THIS host's two services
# still agree — they are separate units with separate config (server/.env `TURN_SECRET` vs coturn's
# `static-auth-secret`), either can be edited alone, and nothing on the box notices when they drift.
#
# The drift is invisible by design, which is why it needs a deliberate check. Every symptom stays
# green: the mint still succeeds, the client still assembles a TURN iceServer, the UI still says
# Reliable. Only the allocation fails — and only for the users whose direct path already failed, who
# are exactly the ones the mode exists for. The first report would come from a user, if it came.
#
# Run it after deploying, after touching either config, and whenever "Reliable" is in doubt:
#
#   bash deploy/verify-relay.sh
#
# Reads the same server env the signaling service runs with (default /var/www/hush-signaling-server/.env)
# for TURN_URLS only — it never reads, prints or needs TURN_SECRET. The credential it uses is minted
# over the WebSocket exactly as a browser would, so this exercises the real path, not a reimplementation.
#
# Needs: node (for the WebSocket), turnutils_uclient (package `coturn`).

The mint succeeded but the allocation did not. Reliable mode is therefore degraded to direct-only on
this host RIGHT NOW: users whose direct path fails will not connect, and the UI cannot tell them why
beyond the relay-unavailable hint. Most likely, in order:
  1. server/.env TURN_SECRET != coturn static-auth-secret (the usual cause — compare, do not assume);
  2. coturn is not running, or not listening on the port TURN_URLS advertises;
  3. the relay port range (min-port..max-port) is closed in the firewall / not forwarded by the router;
  4. TURN_URLS points at a host that is not this coturn.
WHY
fail "the live relay refused a credential the live signaling server minted"
